   I'll tell you what we are doing right now (I sound like a parent). In all seriousness, I have a few motivations for creating a ‚ÄúCoUrSe‚Äù on data science.
  - The first is man's best motivator REJECTION. TLDR is that I‚Äôve been rejected from my dream job at the BBC and I‚Äôve decided that I have to go back to the basics and there is no better way of cementing your knowledge than teaching someone.
  - The second is that I have a younger cousin that looks up to me and depending on when you are reading this he will be going to university in September 2023 I would like to make something he can read in the way that we would speak to each other to make it a lot more digestible
  - The third is that I am unemployed what else am I supposed to do? It's either this or playing League of Legends and I am on a losing streak right now soooo‚Ä¶.
